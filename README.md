# How-To
A runnable exist in the folder : "VS/VS/Build/VS.exe".
This game is inspired from the WC3 mod Rabbits Vs Sheeps. Where the goal is to kill mobs faster then your opponent. If any player have 150 or more minions left for 10 seconds that player lose. To get started you need to add a playername if you dont want to use the generated one. Then chose your hero, more will be developed in the future. Then start the game.
